Changes in MySQL Connector/C 6.1.0 (2013-05-02, General Availability)
=====================================================================
   Functionality Added or Changed
 
     * MySQL Connector/C 6.1 provides these features not present in
       6.0:
 
          + Support for the pluggable authentication framework that
            enables implementation of authentication methods as
            plugins. This framework can be used for MySQL native
            authentication as well as external authentication
            methods. See Pluggable Authentication
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/pluggable-authent
            ication.html).
 
          + Client-side support for the SHA-256, PAM, and Windows
            native authentication plugins. See The SHA-256
            Authentication Plugin
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/sha256-authentica
            tion-plugin.html), The PAM Authentication Plugin
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/pam-authenticatio
            n-plugin.html), and The Windows Native Authentication
            Plugin
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/windows-authentic
            ation-plugin.html).
            The older MySQL Connector/C 6.0 can connect only to
            accounts that use native MySQL passwords. If a client
            program attempts to connect to an account that requires a
            different authentication method, an "Access denied for
            user" error occurs.
 
          + Support for connecting to accounts that have expired
            passwords. See Password Expiration and Sandbox Mode
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/password-expirati
            on.html).
 
          + Support for prepared CALL statements. This enables client
            programs to handle stored procedures that produce
            multiple result sets and to obtain the final value of OUT
            and INOUT procedure parameters. See C API Support for
            Prepared CALL Statements
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/c-api-prepared-ca
            ll-statements.html).
 
          + Support for connecting over IPv6. See IPv6 Support
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/ipv6-support.html
            ).
 
          + Support for binding client programs to a specific IP
            address at connect time. See mysql_options()
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-options.htm
            l).
 
          + Support for specifying connection attributes to pass to
            the server at connect time. See mysql_options()
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-options.htm
            l), and mysql_options4()
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-options4.ht
            ml).
