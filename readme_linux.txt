To run the mex function on a linux matlab, make sure that the proper version of libmysqlclient.so is installed on the system via 
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

The version of system .so files should match the ones with which the mym function was built

The version of .so files with which mym was built are in the mexa64 distribution folder
